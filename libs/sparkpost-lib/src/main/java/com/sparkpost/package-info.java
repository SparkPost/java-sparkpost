/**
 * com.sparkpost provides an interface to the SparkPost
 * REST API.<br>
 * <br>
 * This java API is designed to follow closely the design of the SparkPost
 * REST API. As a result, this java library is composed of 3 groups of java classes:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>com.sparkpost.resources.ResourceXXX classes
 * <li>com.sparkpost.model classes (Data Transfer Objects)
 * <li>REST mechanism classes.
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <h2>Resources classes</h2><br>
 * A resource class is a collection of static methods under one class.<br>
 * All of the methods are a 1-to-1 match with an endpoint within a SparkPost REST API.<br>
 * <br>
 * For instance, the ResourceTransmissions class contains 3 methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>create() matches the create endpoint in the transmission API
 * <li>retrieve() matches the retrieve endpoint in the transmission API
 * <li>list() matches the list endpoint in the transmission API
 * </ul>
 * See the
 * <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/api#/reference/transmissions"> SparkPost Transmission API</a>. <br>
 * <br>
 * <h2>Data Transfer Objects</h2><br>
 * A DTO class is a container of fields which intent is to be serialized into
 * a JSON string when sending a request to a SparkPost API.<br>
 * <br>
 * For instance, the Sending Domains resource ( class ResourceSendingDomains )
 * has a create() method that matches the create endpoint in the SparkPost
 * Sending Domains API.<br>
 * To create a domain, the JSON request to the SparkPost API is made of 2 fields:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>the domain name
 * <li>the DKIM information
 * </ul>
 * We could have designed this java library to merely accept these fields in the
 * method signature , for instance here ResourceSendingDomains.create would
 * have become ResourceSendingDomains.create( String domain, String dkim_info).<br>
 * Only in most cases the request parameters are numerous, and passing them
 * directly as method parameter would become very cumbersome. <br>
 * Instead we use DTOs which represent *exactly* how the JSON request is expressed.<br>
 * As a result, in this example, the create method's signature is :<br>
 * ResourceSendingDomains.create( RestConnection connection, SendingDomain domain)<br>
 * (connection is the server connection to use to make the request, see below)<br>
 * <br>
 * <h2>REST mechanism classes</h2><br>
 * There are 4 classes necessary to put in place our REST system :
 * <ul>
 * <li>Client
 * <li>RestConnection
 * <li>Response
 * <li>SparkPostException
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * Client define information specific to the SparkPost client: the
 * authorization key and the from email.<br>
 * The RestConn does all of the work : it sends requests and receives responses
 * from the SparkPost server. All of the resources methods (see above) take
 * for first parameter an RestConnection object.<br>
 * The Response class describes a response received by the SparkPost server.<br>
 * And finally the SparkPostException is the custom exception for this library.<br>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * See The SampleApplication class for an example of creating a template,
 * storing it, and creating a transmission with it.<br>
 * It also implements a simple JSON-to-Java deserialization using Google's
 * Gson class.
