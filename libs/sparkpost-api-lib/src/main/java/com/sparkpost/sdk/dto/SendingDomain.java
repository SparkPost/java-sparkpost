 * Note: The Sending Domains API is available for SparkPost only.

 * A sending domain is a domain that is used to indicate who an email is from via the
 * "From:" header. Using a custom sending domain enables you to control what
 * recipients see as the From value in their email clients. DNS records can be
 * configured for a sending domain, which allows recipient mail servers to
 * authenticate your messages. The Sending Domains API provides the means to
 * create, list, retrieve, update, and verify a custom sending domain.
