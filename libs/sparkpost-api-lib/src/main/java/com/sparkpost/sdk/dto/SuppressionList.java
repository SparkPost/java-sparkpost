/**
 * A suppression list - or exclusion list, as it is sometimes called - stores a
 * recipient's opt-out preferences. It is a list of recipient email addresses to
 * which you do NOT want to send email. The Suppression List API is used to
 * manage your customer-specific exclusion list entries. An entry indicates
 * whether the recipient requested to receive one of the following:
 * 
 * - Transactional and non-transactional messages from a given customer
 * - Transactional messages only from a given customer
 * - Non-transactional messages only from a given customer
 * - No messages from a given customer
 * 
 * Transactional messages are single recipient messages that are used operationally, 
 * e.g. to reset a password or confirm a purchase; while non-transactional messages 
 * are used to run email campaigns where a list of recipients are targeted, e.g. advertising 
 * a sales event.
 *
 * In addition to the customer-specific exclusion list, Message Systems maintains a global 
 * suppression list across all customers.
